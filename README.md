Try to find trending free agent nba players for my fantasy league

I want to be competetive in my fantasy league. However, I don't want to check player stats everyday.
I want a computer to do that for me. This is a script to find trending free agents.

I want to find the top players for a day (basketball reference already provides that), the top players in a specific time range
(I can either query bb reference a bunch of times and aggregate the data, or store the data in my own database).
I also need to make sure the players returned are free agents in my league (that may be challenging).

Etc.
